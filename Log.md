## What we've learned
- Twit
- Making twitter bots
- Get() and Post()
- The keys (big number/letter codes)

## Still Don't Know
- Stream()
- How to set intervals
- How to apply to canvas

## Creative Ideas
- We can set up a bot for each computer running our program, so that everytime a new x,y coordinate is made, the bot 1 will tweet it out, and bots 2/3/4 will take the tweet and be able to read the coordinates.
